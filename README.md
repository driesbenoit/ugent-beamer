# Version v0.1-2
The aim of this UGent Beamer theme:
* A theme that closely resembles the official UGent Powerpoint/Keynote presentation themes.
* Similar theme options as the [depreciated UGent Beamer theme](https://github.com/pbelmans/ugent-beamer) by Pieter Belmans.
* A corporate version, as well as faculty specific versions.
* Ease-of-use for the average Beamer user.

Requires the packages [sfmath](https://ctan.org/pkg/sfmath),
[helvet](https://ctan.org/pkg/helvet) and [PGF/TikZ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf)
to be installed in your LaTeX distribution.

Also available as [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ugent-beamer/ywtkkxstfgmx).

Download
========
Download the latest release by following [this](https://github.com/driesbenoit/ugent-beamer/releases) link.

Installation
============
The theme is an addendum for the LaTeX beamer class, hence it is assumed that you have a running LaTeX installation together with the beamer package and its dependencies.

Ad-hoc installation 
-------------------
After downloading, you can immediately start working by editing the provided presentation.tex template.

## Usage

After downloading this repository, you can immediately start working by editing the provided presentation.tex template.

You can also install the style globally. Once you have the files, all that is required for the theme to work is putting the files into a directory where LaTeX can find them. This boils down to mimicking the so called TDS (or TeX Directory Structure). In case you're using your favorite flavor of Unix (and/or TeX Live) you need to have a local directory (this will probably be ~/texmf/) and you need to place all the files from the theme folder in the directory ~/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/themes/ugent/, finishing it by running texhash. If on the other hand you're on Windows (probably MiK\TeX) the walkthrough at [this url](http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localadditions.html) explains in detail how to create a local installation. Don't forget to Refresh FNDB as explained [here](http://docs.miktex.org/manual/configuring.html#fndbupdate).
